      <p>On Tuesday morning, assailants who were riding on two motorcycles shot at Gen
        Katumba Wamala’s car, killing his daughter and driver instantly. Although the
        motorcycles commonly known as ‘Boda Boda were used in the assassination, it is
        one which was used to save the General’s life. Hakim Kasibante, a motorcycle rider
        at the Kisaasi stage, is the man who was in the right place, at the right time to rush
        Gen Katumba, “When I heard the bullets, I first entered a banana plantation in fear,
        and dropped the motorcycle,” Kasibante narrated.</p>
      <p>"When the shooting stopped, I left my hiding place and came back on the road.”As
        Gen Katumba called for help, wailing, many people stopped by to take photos and
        videos of what had just happened. Other motorists drove by the bloody scene, but
        not Kasibante.</p>
      <p>
        “Many vehicles passed by, we tried to ask them to take the general to hospital but
        none of them stopped, I wondered if he would allow sitting on my motorcycle,”“I
        rushed and got my Boda and asked him to hop on it. He first hesitated and asked
        us where we were taking him but later accepted to go with us.”Recalling the rush
        to the clinic, Kasibante said that a lot of blood was oozing from Gen Katumba’s
        arms and all he was saying was his daughter’s name – who had just been shot.“I
        was so touched.
      </p>
      <p>
        I helped him like I would help my dad. I helped like Islam demands us too, am a
        Muslim and I can’t leave someone to die yet I know what could help
        them.”Kasibante, on a mobile phone anded to him by a reporter, managed to talk
        to Gen Katumba who thanked him for having a good heart.
